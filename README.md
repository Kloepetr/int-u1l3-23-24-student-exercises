## ‚å®Ô∏è IDEs

Let's begin by understanding what an IDE is. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, which is a software application providing a comprehensive set of tools for software development. It is the place where we can create and edit our code efficiently.

Key features of an IDE include:
- Text Editor: Where you write your code.
- Code Autocompletion: Suggests code snippets and functions to speed up coding.
- Syntax Highlighting: Colors different elements of the code for better readability.
- Debugger: Helps find and fix errors in the code.
- Version Control: Allows tracking changes to code.

## üëæ Replit & GitHub 

Replit is an online IDE that enables coding in various programming languages directly from the browser. It offers a user-friendly and collaborative coding environment without requiring any installations.
